# Bioactivity

By utilising the ChEMBL chemical database of bioactive molecules a search is directed towards the target protein Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, also known as cyclooxygenase-2 or COX-2, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PTGS2 gene.
It is responsible for causing inflammation in humans. By utilising techiniques from the discipline of data science/machine learning
a workflow is presented here starting from initial collection of the data, to cleaning the data all the way through to forming a 
predicitive machine learning model which holds great value for drug discovery efforts.
